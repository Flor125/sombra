**  `Growing in programming` **

I'm a argentina programmer who always trying to lean more about the word of programming. I'm building my version of the digital word one step at time. All coding project are built from the ground up, from planning an designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. At the same time i'm student for my college Universidad Nacional de Villa Mercedes -  Programador de Sistemas, also this is my last year.
